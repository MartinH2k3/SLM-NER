These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug-induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents.","assistant":"{'Chemical': ['morphine', 'morphine'], 'Disease': []}"},{"user":"Apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain.","assistant":"{'Chemical': ['Apomorphine', 'dopamine agonist', 'dopamine'], 'Disease': ['hypothermia']}"},{"user":"From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed. In rats, detection of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions.","assistant":"{'Chemical': ['apomorphine', 'apomorphine'], 'Disease': ['hyperactivity']}"},{"user":"Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug-induced hypothermia. In mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage.","assistant":"{'Chemical': ['apomorphine', 'apomorphine'], 'Disease': ['hypothermia']}"},{"user":"Drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both. By contrast, apomorphine-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box.","assistant":"{'Chemical': ['apomorphine'], 'Disease': []}"}]
